# ML-approach-for-Loan-Prediction

Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows a computer program to automatically learn from a previous task. It works by analysing data, identifying patterns, and incorporating minimal human interventions. Almost any work that can be completed with a data-defined pattern or set of rules can be done with machine learning machines. This allows companies to change processes that were previously only possible for people to make assumptions that respond to customer service calls, bookkeeping, and reviews

Machine Learning is indispensable for the beginner in Data Science, this dataset allows you to work on supervised learning, more preciously a classification problem. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers' segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. 

Based on the combination between the symbols it has been observed that they are more likely to repay their loans. Independent and important qualities can include Property location, education, loan amount, and last in credit History, i.e. from intuition it is considered important. Meeting in between attributes can be seen using corplot and boxplot in the Python platform.
